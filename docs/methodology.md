1. Data Acquisition
Publicly available Indian judiciary case pendency datasets were collected and uploaded to Google BigQuery for scalable analysis.

2. Data Cleaning & Standardization
Raw data fields containing inconsistent naming conventions were normalized, and analytical views were created to standardize case-type and time-based comparisons.

3. Backlog Growth Analysis
State-wise and case-type-wise comparisons were performed to measure changes in pending cases across time periods, identifying regions with significant backlog growth.

4. Case Type Impact Assessment
Civil and criminal case trends were analyzed separately to determine which case categories contribute most to judicial delays.

5. Bottleneck Identification
Analytical rules were applied to classify backlog dominance, enabling targeted insights into procedural inefficiencies.

6. Insight Generation & Visualization
Query outputs were structured for visualization and reporting, enabling judicial stakeholders to interpret trends and support policy-level decision making.
