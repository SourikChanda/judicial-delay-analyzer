India’s judicial system handles millions of cases across civil and criminal domains, 
yet persistent delays continue to impact timely justice delivery.
While case statistics are available through public datasets, they
are not systematically analyzed to identify backlog growth patterns, case-type dominance,
or state-level bottlenecks. 
The absence of a centralized, data-driven analytical framework limits the ability of policymakers
and judicial administrators
to make evidence-based interventions to reduce pendency and improve judicial efficiency.
